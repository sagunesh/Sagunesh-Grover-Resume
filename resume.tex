\section{\sc Academic Projects}

{\bf  \href{https://github.com/sagunesh/Machine-Learning-and-Data-Science/tree/master/KNN\%20on\%20Amazon\%20Review\%20Data\%20Set}{ ML Classfier  for  Amazon Review DataSet using KNN algorithm.}}\hfill {\bf(Individual Project)}\\{\bf(March  --  July 2018)}\\
The main objective was to classify a review, determine whether the review is positive or negative using the given Amazon Review DataSet. Data Analysis and cleaning of data using various techniques like Stemming, Deduplication and  Lemmatization was done.Data was preprocessed  using various techniques like  Bag of Words, TF-IDF, WORD2VEC, Avg Word2Vec and TF-Word2Vec and finally various d dimensions vector were obtained. Various `d' dimensions vectors were reduced to two dimensions vectors respectively using  technique called  TSNE with different levels of perplexity,iterations and learning rate. KNN was applied on  data and it was visualized in two dimensions.\\
